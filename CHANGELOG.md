# CHANGELOG

## v1.1.0
### High level changes 
- Fix initializer to match README instructions

## Breaking code changes
(breaking from v0.5.1)

- Updated the signer so the initializer reads file paths instead of expecting the whole certificate or key.


## v1.0.0
### High level changes 
- released as a new gem called passbook2
  maintains the Passbook namespace because passbook2 replaces passbook and you shouldn't have to type 2 all the time. ðŸ˜‰
- changed method names that were camel case (e.g. `addFile`) to snake case (`add_file`).
- removed generator stuff
- removed requirement for p12 files which Apple no longer supports
- added comments
- README actually reflects the current state of the library

## Breaking code changes
(breaking from the the pre-release version of this fork)

- removed deprecated methods in `PKPass` 
  - `json=(json)`
- changed public method names
  - `addFile` â†’ `add_file`
  - `addFiles` â†’ `add_files`
  - `files` â†’ `list_files`
    This change was to disambiguate from the `file` method which generates a file.
- changed private method names 
  - `checkPass` â†’ `check_pass`
  - `createManifest` â†’ `create_manifest`
  - `outputZip` â†’ `output_zip`
